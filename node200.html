Objects and classes</A>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts. 
</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN"></SPAN></SPAN>
<OL>
<LI>Classes - the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions
</LI>
<LI>Objects - instances of classes
</LI>
</OL><SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">
</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">Objects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as circle, square, menu. An online shopping system might have objects such as shopping cart, customer, and product. Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric. 
</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class (for example, an object with its name field set to Mary might be an instance of class Employee). Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as methods; variables are also known as fields, members, attributes, or properties. This leads to the following terms: 
</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN"></SPAN></SPAN>
<OL>
<LI>Class variables  - belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one
</LI>
<LI>Instance variables or attributes â€“ data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one
</LI>
<LI>Member variables - refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class
</LI>
<LI>Class methods - belong to the class as a whole and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call
</LI>
<LI>Instance methods - belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables
</LI>
</OL><SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">
</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">Objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor. A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.
</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="TINY"><SPAN CLASS="SPAN">Object-oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called class-based programming, while prototype-based programming does not typically use classes. As a result, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of object and instance.
